# task
Possible confisions/problems:
1) small amount of abstractions. Yes we can extract x,y, into Point class and create Drawing system classes in which we will pass our canvas, but we just don't need such abstractions at this moment, because task relatively small.
2) no checks for user file input. It wasn't described in task_description so we leave it as it is. For example we can draw figure untill it crosses canvas borders or we can draw nothing instead of "partial drawing".
3) no tests at this moment
